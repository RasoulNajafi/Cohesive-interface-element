# Cohesive-interface-element
Python code to generate zero thickness cohesive interface elements (COH2D4) among S3 shell elements in Abaqus

In the code, I wrote many comments to make it more understandable

It should be point out that from a computational point of view, this code is not appropriate. The main purpose of this code is to give you a learning platform and ideas to develop your own codes. I guess you would understand it easily. Later on I would modify this code with OOP programming to make it faster and more efficient

In the near future I would add another python code which generates cohesive elements in 3D case in Abaqus

In the Abaqus folder you can find two inp files, the raw one is without cohesive elements and the other is with cohesive elements
